12 People

## Ingredients
 - Chicken
   - 30 pieces chicken (skinless)
   - 1 Lemon
 - Masala
   - 6 big garlic cloves
   - Finger and thumb of ginger
   - 5 medium size onion (6 more for thicker sauce)
   - 4 or 5 green chillis
   - 1 sprig coriander
   - Enough oil/butter to fry
   - 1 tin chopped tomato
 - Spices

## Method

 - Pull the skins off the chicken and cut necessary fat off
   - I like to slice into them with a knife too for added tenderness
   - Use kitchen roll to increase friction when trying to pull the skins off
 - Prep the garlic, ginger, onion
 - Finely dice the onion
 - Fry the onion until browning
 - Whilst the onion is frying, grind the ginger, garlic, chillis and most of the coriander
 - When the onion is brown (a stage later than soft) add the ground mixture
 - Fry until the ginger and onion is cooked, adding more oil if it starts to stick
