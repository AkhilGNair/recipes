## Ingredients

 - Rajma
   - `1` pound of kidney beans
   - `4` ounces channa dal
 - Masala
   - `0.75` chopped tomatoes 
   - `5` big garlic cloves
   - Finger and thumb of ginger
   - `4` medium size onion (`1` more for thicker sauce)
   - `4` Anuj chilli/`2` green chilli
   - Enough oil/butter to fry
 - Spices
   - `1.5` teaspoon salt
   - `0.5` teaspoon haldi
   - `1.75` spoon garam masala
   - `1` spoon red chilli
   - `1` spoon corriander powder

## Method

The rajma is hard and takes a long time to soften - way longer without a pressure cooker.  Whilst the Rajma is in the final boiling stage, we make the masala in parallel.

### Prep Rajma

 - Soak kidneys beans and channa dal overnight
 - Pressure cook for `30` minutes in with haldi, salt, chilli
   - Without pressure cooker, boil for `4` hours with lots of water
 - Boil until soft and saucy thickens (`30` minutes to `1` hour)
    - Rajma should split on a stiff poke
    - A skin forming on top implies the sauce is quite thick

### Make Masala

 - Grind garlic, ginger, and onion in a mini chopper until chunky tasty masala paste
 - Cook in oil until fried brown

Pretty good opportunity to do some cleaning here.

 - When the fried mixture is brown, add garam masala, red chilli powder, corriander powder
 - Fry for another minute to toast the spices
 - Add chopped tomato and cook for about `10` minutes until the tomato is cooked
   - You should see bubbles of oil at the side of the pan

### Combining 

 - Chuck the masala in the rajma
   - The sauce should be instantly thicker
 - Boil for a couple more minutes to mix properly
 - Add salt to taste (maybe half a spoon?)
